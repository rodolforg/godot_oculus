# Oculus SDK GDNative plugin for Godot

**IMPORTANT** for this branch your need to build Godot with PR #27527 applied.
You will also need to copy `modules/gdnative/include/arvr/godot_arvr.h` into `godot_headers/arvr/`
If compiled correctly this module will work on an original Godot 3.1 stable build but the new logic will be unused.

This repository contains the source code for the Oculus plugin for Godot.
See demo project as an example for how to use the plugin.

This is a Windows only plugin!

The leading version of this repository now lives at:
https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_oculus

Versions
--------
Note that due to a breaking change in Godot 3.1 the current master of this repository creates a GDNative module that can only be used with Godot 3.1 or later.

If you want to build this module for Godot 3.0 please checkout the 3.0 branch.
